## Background
Just because a KY-038 board was part of a experimental-kit that I had bought 2 years ago, I decided to give it try.
I was turned out to be a fun exercise.

First to analyse and better understand how the board is working and set it up correctly, second to optimize catching
the digital signal and third to make a working example of a three-clap light on and off switch.

In the document I describe in detail the schema and show scoped signals of the board in action. 
It will provide a better understanding of the challenge and how to connect with the software.
 
## Software installation

The software is included in appendix of the document. It can be copied and paste into an Arduino IDE.
It has been tested with IDE version 1.8.6
